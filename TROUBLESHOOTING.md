# Job Application Tracker - Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue 1: Company Name Not Detected

### Symptoms
- Company name shows as "Unknown Company"
- Company name is incorrect or incomplete
- Company name is missing even when visible on the page

### Solutions

#### 1. Check Page Structure
The extension uses multiple strategies to detect company names:
- **Strategy 1**: Common CSS selectors (`[data-company]`, `.company`, etc.)
- **Strategy 2**: Page title patterns ("Job Title at Company")
- **Strategy 3**: URL analysis (subdomain extraction)
- **Strategy 4**: Meta tags (`og:site_name`, `application-name`)
- **Strategy 5**: Image alt text and logos
- **Strategy 6**: Structured data (JSON-LD)
- **Strategy 7**: Open Graph tags

#### 2. Manual Company Detection
If automatic detection fails:
1. Use the context menu (right-click â†’ "Save job to tracker")
2. Use the floating "Save to Job Tracker" button
3. Use the popup "Save Current Page" button

#### 3. Improve Company Detection
For specific websites, you can:
1. Check the page source for company information
2. Look for structured data in `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags
3. Check meta tags for company information
4. Look for company logos with descriptive alt text

## Issue 2: Extension Not Working on Specific Sites

### Common Job Sites
The extension is designed to work on:
- Lever.co
- Greenhouse.io
- Workday
- Ashbyhq.com
- MyWorkdayJobs.com
- General job posting sites

### Solutions
1. **Check if site is supported**: Look for the floating "Save to Job Tracker" button
2. **Use alternative methods**: Context menu, popup, or floating button
3. **Report unsupported sites**: The extension can be enhanced for new job platforms
